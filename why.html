  <h1>Why Adopt?</h1>
  <img src="Assests/why1.jpg" alt="">
  <p>The unconditional love of an animal is one of the best feelings. 
    An animal will bring years of happiness, laughs, kisses, hugs and love. 
    When the time comes to add a pet to a family, adopting from a local animal shelter is a 
    better option instead of buying from a private breeder. An animal adopted from a local animal shelter obtains 
    a second chance of life instead of dying like the three million euthanised animals. Adoption gives an animal a second 
    chance at life to find a forever home and helps with the control of animal overpopulation.
    A shelter is the best place for adopting any kind of animal. 
    There are various animals in these centres and this makes them the most reliable place to adopt a pet.
    You have made a decision to welcome a new pet in your homestead? Chances of getting a wonderful companion who suits your lifestyle,
      family and home are just perfect.
    People who work at the shelter will be a great resource to help you find information or resources for your pet. 
    Staff members work with animals every day and have a wealth of Information on many different issues.</p>
